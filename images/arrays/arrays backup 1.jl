What is an image on a computer? It's a collection of many (sometimes millions) **pixels** ("picture elements"), in which each one has a single color. The pixels are arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular grid, and the color is specified by indicating how much red, green, blue is in the color. The collection of all these little pixels comprise the image you see.

Suppose now we want to examine a portion of the image in more detail. We'll need a way to specify that portion.

The image is a grid of pixels, and this grid can be thought of as a **two-dimensional array**. Now, in order to refer to a pixel, we need to give a pair of positive integers for the coordinates of that single pixel, one for its horizontal location and one for its vertial. Specifying coordinates like this is called **indexing**. Think of the index of a book, which tells you *on which page* an idea is discussed.

As with one-dimensional arrays, the indices are specified inside square brackets `[  ]`.

A nice way to see this is to use the interactive command `imshow` from the package `ImageView`, loaded at the start. This opens the image in a new window and you can mouse around to see the coordinates of the pointer.

It's to use a `Slider`, which is part of the `PlutoUI` package. We "bind" the slider value to a variable, which can be used later.

Let's show the pixel for the chosen row and column. Notice how the pixel changes as we change their values. This is a consequence of Pluto's **reactivity**: other cells that reference these variables will be immediately updated too. This is especially valuable for learning a new language.

Now that we have access to image data, we can start to *process* that data to extract information and/or modify it in some way.

We might want to detect what type of objects are in the image, say a tree or house or person. To achieve a high-level goal like this, we will need to perform mid-level operations, such as detecting edges that separate different objects based on their color. And, in turn, to carry that out we will need to do low-level operations like comparing colors of neighboring pixels and somehow deciding if they are different.

Let's look more at colors. We can  use indexing to modify a pixel's color. To do so, we need a way to specify a new color.

Color turns out to be a complicated concept, having to do with the interaction of the physical properties of light with the physiological mechanisms and mental processes by which we detect it!

We use a standard method of representing colors in the computer as an **RGB triple**, which is a set of three numbers (r, g, b), giving the amount of red, of green and of blue in a colour, respectively. These are numbers between 0 (none) and 1 (full).

An image is a concrete example of a fundamental concept in computer science, namely an **array**.

Just as an image is a rectangular grid, where each grid cell contains a single color,
an array is a rectangular grid for storing data. Data is stored and retrieved using indexing, just as in the image examples: each cell in the grid can store a single "piece of data" of a given type.

An array can be one-dimensional, like the strip of pixels above, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and so on. The dimension tells us the number of indices that we need to specify a unique location in the grid. The array object also needs to know the length of the data in each dimension.

One-dimensional arrays are often called **vectors** and two-dimensional arrays are **matrices**.

An array is an example of a **data structure**, i.e. a way of arranging data such that we can access it. A key theme in computer science is that of designing different data structures that represent data in different ways.

Conceptually, we can think of an array as a block of data that has a position or location in space. This can be a useful way to arrange data if, for example, we want to represent the fact that values in nearby locations in array are somehow near to one another.

Images are a good example of this: neighbouring pixels often represent different pieces of the same object, for example the rug or floor, or Philip himself, in the photo. We thus expect neighbouring pixels to be of a similar color. On the other hand, if they are not, this is also useful information, since that may correspond to the edge of an object.

Notice what happened when we used spaces to separate elements instead of commas. Now the construction is a matrix and it's two dimensional: 1 row and 3 columns in this case.

We can generalize this using a ";" to make a matrix with more than one row.

It's clear that if we want to create an array with more than a few elements, it will be very tedious to do so by hand like this.
Rather, we want to *automate* the process of creating an array by following some pattern, for example to create a whole palette of colors!

Let's start with all the possible colors interpolating between black, `RGB(0, 0, 0)`, and red, `RGB(1, 0, 0)`.  Since only one of the values is changing, we can represent this as a vector.

A Julia method to do this is an **array comprehension**. Again we use square brackets  to create an array, but now we use a variable that runs over a given range values.

The syntax `0:0.1:1` is a **range**. The first and last numbers are the start and end values, and the middle number is the size of the step. The `=` sign after the `for` statement can be replaced by `in`, but I usually prefer the equal sign.
